## Looking for the Flutter Files?
  1.) Click into the chem_series/ folder
  2.) Click into the lib/ folder

## Purpose
  To create a static flutter app that will calculate the three series: Lyman, Balmer, Paschen.

## Input
  Number to determine each series output

## ORIGINAL Author
   My brother Matthew Badia originally wrote using python in the unix command line. 
   He's a chemist, not a programmer (That's where I come in).
   
## A Note to whom it may concern 
  I'd say ALL Credit goes to my brother who provided me with such calculations. I honestly have no idea if they are right. 
  I don't know what a series is. I understand programming, math and I do have a basic grasp in college introductory level chemistry.
  I am by no means on the level of my brother. He emailed me the code, so I could just 'go wild' with it.
  I am just providing a better implementation than what my brother did. Thanks Matt!
